# S/M-KID-Council

The **Software Technology, Mathematics & Technology, and Artificial Intelligence and Data Study Council** (S/M-KID-Council) consists of approximately 120 members across the study lines. We meet once every month and aim to create a cozy atmosphere at the meetings. To foster this, we enjoy dinner together before the meetings and typically indulge in some delicious cake.

## Our Focus

We strive to provide the best possible social study environment for students in the associated study lines. This is achieved through organizing a variety of social events such as:
- Christmas party
- Easter dinner
- All-girls dinner
- Cabin trips
- Other events that members wish to host

In addition, we collaborate with different companies to arrange academic events relevant to our students, often including networking sessions.

## Stay Updated

If you're interested in seeing all the exciting things we do, be sure to like our Facebook page: [**S/M-KID RÃ¥dets Infoside**](https://www.facebook.com/SMKIDCouncil). We aim to keep everyone updated on this platform.
